# Calories-Project 
## I wanted to learn how to use pivot tables and I also wanted to lose 5-10lbs. I decided to track everything I ate for about two months, and it worked! Here is a snapshot of my spreadsheet.

##### TLDR: Counting kcals and analyzing my findings helped me discover I was eating most of my calories during dinner, sometimes skipping breakfast or lunch, but usually making up for that during snack time or at dinner. Perhaps more importantly, gathering and inputing data showed me the importance of clean and reliable data, but also showed that you can have errors even when you are soley in control of the information. & I lost 5 lbs!

#### Here is a snapshot of my data. As you can see, meals were defined as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. I found that while it was interesting to see how much what I ate each day, I was not able to see patterns that easily from the data table alone. (Note: yellow indicates I was eating a plant-based diet that week.)

#### Average (mean) was found by counting the number of rows and then dividing by the total calories consumed. It was amazing how much one big day would skew my average, particularly when number of total days was low.

#### A simple bar graph led to questions and a few insights.
##### -First, what happened that weekend in august?? 
##### -Second, the week where I was vegan is barely discernable from the rest (Sept 10th-16th). This tells me I was able to get more than enough calories during that week. 
##### -Third, 8/31-9/5 was a week where I was able to keep the calorie count very low. I was traveling this week, walking around a lot and not spending much time looking for things to eat. Normally I would have expected to eat more calories while traveling so this was an interesting discovery.

#### I used a Pivot table (shown below) to see the distribution of kcals throughout my date, as a percentage of the total kcals that day. This ended up being a very valuable insight that lead to me reducing the size of my dinner and snack kcals, and adding those kcals to lunch. I will typically have a healthier meal for lunch that I would if I was just snacking, so this is a better place to get those kcals.
