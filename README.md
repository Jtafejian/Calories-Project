# Calories-Project 
## I wanted to learn how to use pivot tables and I also wanted to lose 5-10lbs. I decided to track everything I ate for about two months, and it worked! Here is a snapshot of my spreadsheet.

#### Here is a snapshot of my data table. As you can see, meals were defined as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. I found that while it was interesting to see how much what I ate each day, I was not able to see patterns that easily from the data table alone. (Note: yellow indicates I was eating a plant-based diet that week.)

#### Average(mean) was found by counting the number of rows and then dividing by the total calories consumed.
